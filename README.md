# StraySAFE
Got a missing pet? Are you worried or stressed? Well do not fear, StraySAFE is here!

<strong><big>Description:📝</big></strong><br/>
 it takes </color> a long time for a team to coordinate effectively when faced with a limit interval of time. However, our team was able to form a compressive Idea that can be the resolution to our previously inquired dilemma of pets “going missing”. We came up with developing a website(StraySAFE) that may be used by all pet owners to be able to report missing pets in an easy and quick manner. the website will allow for registration for not only those who wish to report, but for those to respond to search requests. We implemented a situation for reporting animals that allows for any individual utilizing StraySpace to find pets that went missing near their location or the location of the post. Since there is no stable system available, we wish to be the first to improve and help rescue pets from everywhere. A system with a focus that eases the worries of owners and brings a more controlled environment for pets to live in.

<strong><big>Inspiration:💡</big></strong><br/>
When it came to the development of StraySAFE, our goal was to aspire to create a unique system that enables environmental sustainability for pet owners, and the safe keeping of their household pets. We were shocked to find find limit resources available for those who have to experience the stress of losing a pet or being endangered by an animal. Our team brought our heads together and developed a system that is user-friendly and can be emplaced for all pet owners that may be across the globe.

<strong><big> Challenges We ran into:⚔️</big></strong><br/>⚔
We did our best effort attempted to work efficiently and effectively. But this did leave for some trecherous obstacles for us to overcome. One of the largest of issues was stylizing the website with CSS, this took a decent amount of time and gave us some tecnical issues as well, due to the goal of ours to create a clean and user-friendly UI. The other obstacle occured in the backend part of the process, we experienced some issues.

<strong><big>Targeted Audience:👥</big></strong><br/>
The audience is an expansive ideology, at first StraySAFE caters towards lawful pet owners, or people who are in some way or shape involved with domestic animals. although this may seem to be the case, we believe this will in fact allow for known pet owners to be contributing members of society, as well as bring confidents for new and aspiring pet owners. Remember a protective and safe pet environment will allow for future pet owners to be more relaxed when it comes to taking care of their animal.

<strong><big>Functionality Requirements:✅</big></strong><br/>
In order for this to be a functional website,  it requires of mix of developing using frontend/backend programming languages. For the implementation of StraySAFE we used HTML CSS, Twilio, and JavaScript.
